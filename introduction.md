# Introduction
## Purpose of the Document

This Guideline has been prepared to provide technical information required in the development of VDES equipment, which integrates the functions of VHF data exchange (VDE), application specific messages (ASM) and the automatic identification system (AIS) in the VHF maritime mobile band (156.025-162.025 MHz).

This document refers to ITU Recommendation ITU-R M.2092-0, and is not intended to replace that document.  The IALA Guideline on Technical Specifications of VDES provides additional detail on VDES, and will be amended as required to reflect experience in implementing the technical solutions for VDES.  As this IALA Guideline is revised, input will be included, as appropriate, as a working document towards a revision of ITU-R M.2092.  It is intended that this input will be provided to the appropriate working group of ITU following the results of the ITU WRC-19.

Persons using this document are encouraged to provide comments, corrections and further input on developments to IALA.  In addition, persons who are implementing VDES are invited to participate in further work on the system through the IALA ENAV Committee.  It is noted that, as VDES develops, any deployment of VDES will need to comply with the appropriate ITU regulation, once they are agreed.

It is noted that, following WRC-15, the full satellite capability of VDES is being studied at ITU and will be reviewed at WRC-19. This IALA Guideline includes the full capability (including satellite).
