# VDES Channel Usage in Accordance with ITU RR Appendix 18
This section provides information on channel usage between terrestrial stations and between satellite and terrestrial stations.

## VDES: Data Exchange between Terrestrial Stations
* AIS 1 (channel 2087) and AIS 2 (channel 2088) are AIS channels, in accordance with Recommendation ITU-R M.1371

* ASM 1 (channel 2027) and ASM 2 (channel 2028) are the channels used for application specific messages (ASM)

* VDE1-A lower legs (channels 1024, 1084, 1025, 1085) are ship-to-shore VDE

* VDE1-B upper legs (channels 2024, 2084, 2025, 2085) are shore-to-ship and ship-to-ship VDE.

## VDES: Data Exchange between Satellites and Terrestrial Stations

* AIS 1 (channel 2087) and AIS 2 (channel 2088) are terrestrial AIS channels that are also used as uplinks for receiving AIS messages by satellite

* Long Range AIS using channel 75 and channel 76 are specified channels to be used as uplinks for receiving AIS messages by satellite. SAT Up1 (channel 2027) and SAT Up 2 (channel 2028) are used for receiving ASM by satellite

* SAT Up3 (channels 1024, 1084, 1025, 1085, 1026 and 1086) are used for ship-to-satellite VDE uplinks

* SAT Downlink (channels 2024, 2084, 2025, 2085, 2026 and 2086) are used for satellite-to-ship VDE downlinks.
