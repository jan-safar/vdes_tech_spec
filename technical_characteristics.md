# Technical Characteristics
A general overview of the technical aspects of VDES is provided in IALA Guideline 1117.  This section provides more detailed technical characteristics. 

## Shipborne VDES Receivers are Protected
As in AIS, shipborne VDES receivers are on the upper legs of RR Appendix 18, 4.6 MHz above the lower legs, which facilitates protection by filtering from receiver blocking by ships VHF radios.

## SAT Downlink
The satellite downlink complies with the power flux-density (PFD) mask described in Table A4-1 to minimize interference to terrestrial services and to maximize reception by ship VDES stations.

## VDES1 Uses Both Legs of the Duplex Channels
Channel capacity is utilized for the duplex channels in VDE1 by using the lower legs (VDE1-A) for ship-to-shore and the upper legs (VDE1-B) for shore-to-ship and ship-to-ship digital messaging.

Table 1 describes the RR Appendix 18 channels used for the various applications of VDES.
