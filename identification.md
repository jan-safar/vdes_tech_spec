# Identification
Identification and location of all active maritime stations is provided automatically by means of the AIS. All VDES stations should be uniquely identified. For the purpose of identification, a unique numerical identifier is used as defined by the following:

* If the unique identifier has a range which is less than 999999999, then this number is defined by the latest version of Recommendation ITU-R M.585. 

* If the unique identifier has a range which is greater than 999999999, then this is number is free form.
