# Operational Characteristics
In general, VDES should meet the following:

1.	The system should give its highest priority to the automatic identification system (AIS) position reporting and safety related information.

1.	The system installation should be capable of receiving and processing the digital messages and interrogating calls specified by this Recommendation.

1.	The system should be capable of transmitting additional safety information on request.

1.	The system installation should be able to operate continuously while under way, moored or at anchor.

1.	The system should use for the terrestrial links time-division multiple access (TDMA) techniques, access schemes and data transmission methods in a synchronized manner as specified in the Annexes.

1.	The system should be capable of various modes of operation, including the autonomous, assigned and polled modes.

1.	The system should provide flexibility for the users in order to prioritize some applications and, consequently, adapt some parameters of the transmission (robustness or capacity) while minimizing system complexity.

1.	The system should address the use cases identified in Report ITU-R M.2371.

## General Description of VDES
A detailed overview of VDES, and VDES operations, is provided in IALA Guideline 1117 (latest edition).  In essence, The VDES provides a variety of means for the exchange of data between maritime stations, ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore, shore-to ship, ship-to-satellite and satellite-to-ship. The VDES functionally includes the AIS, either by integration, by interface connection or by radio frequency connection.  

## VDES Functions and Frequency Usage
The system concept, including VDES functions and frequency usage are illustrated pictorially in Figure 2 (full system).  Please note â€“ SAT Up is received only by Satellite.
